The process of digestion and absorption starts with food and ends with poop. Food gets broken down or digested and then absorbed. Gut bacteria also survive off of food. Poop is essentially digested food and gut bacteria. The gut lumen is home to  the microbiome which includes bacteria, yeasts and virus’.<\/p><p><strong>Mucus Layer:<br\/><\/strong>The mucus layer is a viscous, gel-like substance that lines the lumen. It helps move digesting food, supports microbes and functions as a protective barrier. Secretory IgA (sIgA) is the first line of defense at the gut lining. <\/p><p><strong>Gut Epithelium:<\/strong><br\/>The gut epithelium makes up the lining of the gut. It is made up of individual intestinal cells also called epithelial cells. A healthy epithelial layer helps to absorb nutrients and prevents passage of harmful substances. Epithelial cells are held together with Tight Junctions (TJ). Zonulin, triggered by gluten or gut bacteria, can remove the TJ’s and lead to a leaky gut or increased permeability of the epithelium. <\/p><p><strong>Gut Lamina Propria:<\/strong><br\/>The gut lamina propria lies beneath the epithelial lining. It’s rich in blood vessels and immune cells. It helps to transports nutrients into circulation. The area is also rich in immune cells that help to monitor and respond to threats such as pathogens and antigens.<\/p><ul><li>Gut dysbiosis causes inappropriate production of increased amount of zonulin with subsequent functional loss of gut barrier function<\/li><li>Fecal Calprotectin plays a major role during inflammation and is considered to be a positive acute phase protein. It is a component of neutrophils, a type of white blood cells.<\/li><\/ul>"
