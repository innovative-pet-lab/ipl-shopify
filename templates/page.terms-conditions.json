This Agreement and any SOW thereof shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without giving effect to Innovative Pet Labs of conflict of law that would result in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction, and the Parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in any state or federal court located in Georgia with respect to all disputes arising hereunder.
