She holds a Masters of Medical Science (MMSc) from Emory University, a Ph.D. in Nutrition from the University of Georgia. Her research has included evaluating the impact of diet on colon health, how to target education to make changes that improve laboratory values, and in translational science finding the best ways to move new research into applied clinical care. In her professional work, she was a member of the team that brought the first available gut microbiome PCR test to market and has researched how to apply metabolomics (the study of metabolites) in clinical practice and the differences across species. As a co-founder of Innovative Pet Lab Betsy’s goal is to provide easy-to-use testing that gives pet owners a deeper understanding of their pet’s overall health and actionable steps.  Dr. Redmond lives in Atlanta and enjoys spending time with her husband, three kids, and two dogs Ollie and Linda. She also enjoys running and can never get enough of researching the right answer.<\/p>"
